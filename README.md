# Canonical Genetic Algorithm for Multivariate Equation

A canonical genetic algorithm (CGA) is a type of evolutionary algorithm used for solving multivariate equations. It is based on the principles of natural selection and genetic recombination. The algorithm works by creating a population of potential solutions, selecting the fittest individuals, and combining them to create new, better solutions. The process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found.

The CGA works by randomly generating a population of potential solutions to a multivariate equation. Each individual in the population is represented by a string of numbers that correspond to the coefficients of the equation. Individual solutions are then evaluated according to their fitness, which is determined by how closely the coefficients match the equation's solution. The fittest individuals are then selected, and the corresponding coefficients are recombined to form new solutions. This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found. The CGA is an effective method for solving multivariate equations because it can quickly find solutions with high accuracy. It is also efficient, as it only needs to evaluate a small number of solutions before finding a good one. Additionally, it is easy to implement and can be used to solve equations of any complexity.

The CGA is also robust, meaning that it can handle changes in the equation's coefficients without much difficulty. This makes it ideal for solving equations that are subject to frequent changes, such as those used in financial forecasting.Despite its advantages, CGA does have some drawbacks. First, it is not capable of solving equations with more than three unknowns. Second, it does not work well with equations that have many constraints or are highly nonlinear. Finally, the CGA is not suitable for equations that require a high degree of accuracy.

Overall, the CGA is an effective and efficient algorithm for solving multivariate equations. It is easy to implement and can quickly find solutions with high accuracy. Additionally, it is robust and can handle changes in the equation's coefficients without much difficulty. However, it is not suitable for equations with more than three unknowns or those that require a high degree of accuracy.

## Repository Type: Academic Project

# Project Description
NCSU ECE-592(084) (Optimization and Algorithms) Project 1
- Instructor: Prof. Shih-Chun Lin
- Implement the Canonical Genetic Algorithm for the given Multivariate Equation, and produce plots of the best, average, and the worst objective function values in the population for every generation.
  
## About
- ak_codes has the code file which has comments for reference. 
- CgeneticAlgo is the main code and CrossMuta, bit2num, and evaluationSelect are the defination/functiono codes required so saving them is suggested.
- The input function is predefined and the CGA finds the global maxima of the function and global minima if the function is multiplied with -1.
- The output Graph will different for each time one runs the code but the end point will always be the same.
